# Angular version of the Vivid Ciphers Social-Network-Project

* For this version of the project the `master` repository will be `Social-Network---Angular-Version`
* All development for this version will be done in the `angular-develop` repository
* Features, bug fixes, and code refactors will be done in working branches off of `angular-develop`

Here's how this is done:

When you want to work on something, make sure you are in the `angular-develop` repo, and type
```git branch -b <my awesome branch>```

This will give you a new branch off of `angular-develop` that you can work on. When you're finished with your work, type
```git push origin <my awesome branch>```

And do a pull request to merge your feature branch into `angular-develop`
